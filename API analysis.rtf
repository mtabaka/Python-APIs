\f0\fs24 \cf0 Analysis:\
Based on the data from the openweathermap API, it seems safe to say that higher temperatures are found closer to the equator.  I can\'92t see any evidence that Latitude has an effect on humidity or wind, but this may differ with a different city sample.  \
I expected to see more cloudiness near the equator, but this did not appear in the plot.  }
